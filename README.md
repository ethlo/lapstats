# LapStats
A simple tool to work with lap-times and associated statistics.

## Motivation
Typically one does not have GPS or sector times for RC or other more simplistic timing systems, however it is still interesting to see what is the standing compared to other drivers.

The project aims to generate statistics and simple approximations to position and ahead/behind relative to other drivers. 

## Supported data sources
* MyRCM

## Examples
An early example of usage of the data output as SRT (a simple and common subtitle format), and use that for outputting stats every time the driver passes start/finish:
