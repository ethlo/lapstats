# LapStats

A simple tool to work with lap times and associated statistics.

## Examples

* Rendering using Javascript and HTML; https://youtu.be/mcqrM_6t5hk
* Output as SRT (a simple and common subtitle format) and use that for outputting stats every time the driver passes start/finish: https://youtu.be/wvPF6nZTDqk

## Motivation

Typically there are no GPS or sector times for RC or other more simplistic timing systems, however, it is still
interesting to see what is the race standing compared to other drivers.

The project aims to generate statistics and simple approximations to position and ahead/behind relative to other
drivers.

## Supported data sources

* MyRCM
